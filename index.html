        <p><b>LOCATION:</b> Cambridgeport, Cambridge. 10 min walk to MIT, 20 minute walk to Harvard. We're also just a few blocks from Trader Joe's and Whole Foods. Central Square is a 10 minute walk away. Also, the #47 bus to Longwood Medical passes our front door.</p>

        <p><b>ABOUT THE HOUSE:</b> The house itself is pretty awesome. We have 2 1/2 floors of a three-story house from the 1850`s.

The entire ground floor is open, with a kitchen in the middle and two living rooms on either side. Please note there is only ONE bathroom in the house. We all have different schedules, so it works out. NO PETS, sorry. The house has a funky, kitschy vibe.</p>

        <p><b>ABOUT THE HOUSEMATES:</b> Software developer at an NLP startup (female, from NYC), Berklee grad student studying music therapy (male, from India), Tufts grad student studying ethnomusicology (female, from Iowa), professional driver for a medical diagnostic company (male, from Senegal). All mostly in their early 30's and up.</p>

        <p><b>ABOUT YOU:</b> Professional, academic, or professional academic. Late 20's and up. Easy going, <i>clean</i>, and respectful. Comfortable living with people from different backgrounds.</p>
